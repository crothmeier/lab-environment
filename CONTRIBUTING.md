# Contributing

Contributions to **Lab Environment** are welcome if you have ideas to enhance the examples. However, this repository mainly serves as documentation of a reference lab setup, so contributions are entirely optional.

## How to Contribute

1. **Fork the repo** if you'd like to propose changes.
2. **Create a branch** for your changes (e.g., `update/network-diagram`).
3. **Implement your changes** (add your config or update documentation).
4. **Open a Pull Request** with a clear description of your changes and why they're useful.

## Guidelines

- Keep additions generic and broadly applicable (so others can benefit from them).
- Do not include sensitive information from your own lab (like real passwords or keys).
- Ensure any diagrams or documents added are your own or properly licensed.

All contributions will be under the MIT License as stated in LICENSE.md.
